                        <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">The primary goals for winter are to keep goats warm, dry, and well-fed, as they burn extra calories to maintain body temperature.</p>
                        <ul class="space-y-3 list-disc list-inside text-slate-700">
                            <li><strong>Shelter:</strong> Ensure the barn is draft-free at goat level but well-ventilated up high. Goats do <strong>not</strong> need a heated or insulated barn; their cashmere undercoats and huddling behavior keep them warm. A tightly sealed barn can trap ammonia, leading to dangerous respiratory damage before you can even smell it.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bedding:</strong> Use a deep litter method with straw, which is much warmer and offers better insulation from the cold ground than wood shavings.</li>
                            <li><strong>Water:</strong> Use heated buckets or a tank de-icer. Goats will not drink enough if their water is icy, which can lead to dehydration and other health issues.</li>
                            <li><strong>Feed:</strong> Increase hay rations, especially for pregnant does. Monitor Body Condition Score (BCS) to ensure they aren't losing weight.</li>
                            <li><strong>Health:</strong> Watch for signs of respiratory illness (coughing, runny nose). Check for external parasites like lice, which thrive in winter coats.</li>
                        </ul>

                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Spring brings new life, lush pasture, and the peak season for parasites.</p>
                <ul class="space-y-3 list-disc list-inside text-slate-700">
                    <li><strong>Kidding Season:</strong> Be prepared with a clean kidding stall and your emergency kit. This is the busiest time of year!</li>
                    <li><strong>Pasture Management:</strong> Introduce goats to lush spring grass gradually over a week to prevent bloat. Start with just an hour of grazing per day.</li>
                    <li><strong>Parasite Patrol:</strong> Worm larvae thrive in the cool, moist conditions of spring. Begin regular FAMACHA checks and plan to run fecal tests to stay ahead of parasite loads.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hoof Trimming:</strong> Soft, wet ground means hooves won't wear down naturally. Schedule a herd-wide trim.</li>
                </ul>

                        <ul class="space-y-3 list-disc list-inside text-slate-700">
                            <li><strong>Shade and Water:</strong> Goats must have access to shade at all times. Provide multiple water sources and scrub buckets often to prevent algae growth.</li>
                            <li><strong>Heat Stress:</strong> Signs include rapid panting, lethargy, and decreased appetite. Offer electrolytes in a separate bucket of water during extreme heat waves.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fly Control:</strong> Use fly traps, fly predators, or vet-approved repellents to keep flies from bothering your herd and spreading disease like pinkeye.</li>

                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">As the days shorten, the focus shifts to breeding season and preparing for the coming winter.</p>
                <ul class="space-y-3 list-disc list-inside text-slate-700">
                    <li><strong>Breeding Season (The Rut):</strong> Does will come into heat and bucks will be in full rut. Plan your breedings and keep meticulous records of dates.</li>
                    <li><strong>Health Checks:</strong> Perform a final herd health check before winter sets in. Check body condition, perform FAMACHA scores, and deworm if necessary.</li>
                    <li><strong>Barn Prep:</strong> Inspect the barn and fencing for any needed repairs. Stock up on hay and bedding for the winter months.</li>
