                        <p><strong id="cae" class="text-slate-800">CAE (Caprine Arthritis Encephalitis):</strong> A contagious and incurable viral disease, primarily affecting dairy goats. It is most often transmitted from an infected doe to her kids through colostrum or milk. It can cause chronic arthritis (painful, swollen joints, especially knees), "hard udder" mastitis, and in rare cases, encephalitis in young kids. There is no treatment, which is why buying from a herd that tests negative for CAE is the single most important step for a new goat owner.</p>
                    </div>
                     <div>
                        <p><strong id="cl" class="text-slate-800">CL (Caseous Lymphadenitis):</strong> A chronic, contagious bacterial infection that causes abscesses in the lymph nodes, most commonly around the jaw, neck, and shoulders. These abscesses contain a thick, pus-like material. The bacteria can survive in the soil for years. While not always fatal, it is incurable and can significantly impact a goat's health and the biosecurity of your farm. Testing and culling infected animals is the primary management strategy.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p><strong id="johnes" class="text-slate-800">Johne's Disease:</strong> A fatal and contagious gastrointestinal disease caused by bacteria that leads to a slow, progressive wasting of the animal. Symptoms, which often don't appear for years, include chronic diarrhea and severe weight loss despite a good appetite. It is transmitted primarily through manure. Like CAE and CL, it is incurable, and buying from tested-negative herds is essential.</p>

                        <p><strong id="cdt" class="text-slate-800">CDT Vaccine &amp; Tetanus Prevention:</strong> The core vaccine for goats is "CDT," which protects against *Clostridium perfringens* types C & D (enterotoxemia or "overeating disease") and Tetanus. For tetanus protection, it is critical to understand the two different types of injections:</p>
                        <ul class="mt-2 space-y-2 list-disc list-inside text-sm pl-4">
                           <li><strong>Tetanus Toxoid:</strong> This is the "vaccine" part of the CDT shot. It works by stimulating the goat's own immune system to create long-lasting antibodies against the tetanus toxin. It is used for routine, preventative care. It requires a booster and takes about two weeks to become fully effective.</li>
                           <li><strong>Tetanus Antitoxin:</strong> This is an injection of pre-made antibodies that provides immediate but temporary protection (about 7-10 days). It is used for emergencies, such as after an injury in an unvaccinated goat, or to give immediate protection to newborn kids whose mother was not vaccinated before birth.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p><strong id="famacha" class="text-slate-800">FAMACHA:</strong> A system for assessing anemia by checking the color of a goat's lower eyelids against a special chart. Pale membranes indicate blood loss, which in goats is most often caused by a heavy infestation of the deadly barber pole worm (*Haemonchus contortus*). This allows for selective deworming of only the animals that need it, which helps combat parasite resistance.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p><strong id="coccidiosis" class="text-slate-800">Coccidiosis:</strong> A common and potentially deadly parasitic disease in kids, caused by a protozoa called *coccidia*. It thrives in wet, crowded conditions and damages the intestinal lining, causing severe, often watery or bloody diarrhea (scours). It is a major cause of death in kids between 3 weeks and 5 months of age. Prevention through clean, dry living conditions is critical.</p>
