                    <li><strong>Herd Animals:</strong> Goats have a strong herd instinct and a clear pecking order. The "herd queen" usually eats first. Never keep a single goat alone.</li>
                    <li><strong>Curious &amp; Intelligent:</strong> Goats are incredibly smart and inquisitive. This is why they test fences and get into trouble. They need mental stimulation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Creatures of Habit:</strong> They thrive on routine. Feeding at the same time every day reduces stress.</li>
                    <li><strong>Playful Nature:</strong> Goats, especially kids, love to run, jump, and play "king of the mountain." This is normal and healthy behavior.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Enrichment prevents boredom, which in turn prevents bad habits like fence-chewing or bullying.</p>

                            <li><strong>Things to Climb:</strong> This is the most important enrichment. Large rocks, wooden spools, sturdy platforms, and even old picnic tables make fantastic goat toys.</li>
                            <li><strong>Browse &amp; Treats:</strong> Securely hang branches from non-poisonous trees (like pine or maple) for them to nibble on. Use puzzle balls designed for horses to make them work for their treats.</li>
                            <li><strong>New Scents &amp; Objects:</strong> Occasionally add a new (goat-safe) object to their pen for them to investigate, like a traffic cone or a new brush bolted to a post for scratching.</li>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4">Basic Training</h2>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">A little training makes handling your goats for health checks and hoof trimming much easier and less stressful for everyone.</p>
                <ul class="space-y-3 list-disc list-inside text-slate-600">
                    <li><strong>Lead Training:</strong> Get your goats used to wearing a collar from a young age. Start by leading them short distances with a leash, using small treats like sunflower seeds as a reward. Keep sessions short and positive.</li>
                    <li><strong>Training for the Milk Stand:</strong> Even if you don't have dairy goats, training them to hop onto a stand and eat a small treat is invaluable for hoof trimming and vet checks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dealing with Head-Butting:</strong> A goat that head-butts people can be dangerous. Never play head-butting games with them, especially when they are young and cute. A firm "No!" and a quick, surprising squirt from a water bottle can deter this behavior.</li>
