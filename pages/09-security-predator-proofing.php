                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4">Layer 1: The Perimeter Fence</h2>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Your main fence is your first and most important line of defense.</p>
                <ul class="space-y-3 list-disc list-inside text-slate-700">
                    <li><strong>Woven Wire is Best:</strong> 4-foot tall (or higher) 2"x4" no-climb horse fence or 4"x4" goat and sheep fence is ideal. It's strong and the small openings prevent predators from getting through and goats from getting their heads stuck.</li>
                    <li><strong>Electric Strands:</strong> Adding one or two "hot" strands of electric wire can be a powerful deterrent. Place one strand near the top of the fence to stop climbers (like cougars) and one near the bottom (6 inches off the ground) to stop diggers (like coyotes and dogs).</li>
                    <li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Walk your fence line weekly. Check for downed limbs, gaps under the fence, and ensure your electric charger is working.</li>

                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Most predator attacks happen at night. A secure night-time enclosure is critical.</p>

                            <li><strong>Solid Doors &amp; Latches:</strong> Your barn or shelter must have a solid door that can be securely latched.</li>
                            <li><strong>Secure Openings:</strong> Cover all windows and vents with sturdy hardware cloth to prevent smaller predators like raccoons or weasels from entering.</li>
                            <li><strong>Deterrents:</strong> Motion-activated lights or radios can startle and deter nocturnal predators.</li>

                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Unfortunately, animal theft is a real concern, especially for friendly, well-bred goats. It's wise to take some precautions against human threats as well.</p>
                 <ul class="space-y-3 list-disc list-inside text-slate-700">
                    <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Keep your night pen and kidding areas out of easy sight from the main road if possible.</li>
                    <li><strong>Signage:</strong> Prominently display "Private Property" and "Biosecurity in Effect" signs. This can deter casual visitors and signals that you take your herd's health and security seriously.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cameras:</strong> Simple, affordable farm or game cameras placed at key access points can be a powerful deterrent and are invaluable for identification if a theft does occur.</li>
                    <li><strong>Know Your Neighbors:</strong> A strong relationship with your neighbors is one of the best security tools. They can be an extra set of eyes and ears when you are not home.</li>
