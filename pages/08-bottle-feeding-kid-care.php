It is absolutely vital for their survival.</p>
                        <ul class="space-y-3 list-disc list-inside text-slate-700">
                            <li><strong>Timing is Everything:</strong> A kid's gut can only absorb these large antibody molecules for the first 12-24 hours of life. They need to get colostrum as soon as possible after birth, ideally within the first hour.</li>
                            <li><strong>How Much:</strong> Aim for 10-12% of the kid's body weight in colostrum within the first 24 hours, divided into 3-4 feedings. (e.g., a 5lb kid needs about 8oz total).</li>
                            <li><strong>Backup Plan:</strong> Always have a backup supply. You can freeze colostrum from a healthy doe for up to a year. Thaw it gently in a warm water bath—never microwave it, as that will destroy the antibodies. If you don't have any, a high-quality powdered colostrum replacer is the next best thing.</li>

                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">New goat owners are often alarmed to find a squishy lump under the throat of a fast-growing, healthy kid. In most cases, this is a harmless condition known as milk goiter.</p>
                <div class="prose prose-slate max-w-none">
                    <ul class="space-y-2">
                        <li>It is NOT a true goiter, which is caused by an iodine deficiency. Do not supplement with iodine unless directed by a vet, as you can cause iodine toxicity.</li>
                        <li>It is thought to be an inflammation of the thymus gland, which is part of the immune system. It appears in kids between 2 weeks and 4 months of age who are growing very quickly.</li>
                        <li>The lump feels soft and fluid-filled and will eventually disappear on its own as the kid matures. As long as the kid is otherwise healthy, active, and eating well, a milk goiter is not a cause for concern.</li>
