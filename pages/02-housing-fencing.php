                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Goats hate being wet and need a place to escape wind, rain, snow, and summer sun. A simple three-sided structure is often sufficient.</p>

                        <ul class="space-y-3 list-disc list-inside text-slate-700">
                            <li><strong>Keep it Dry:</strong> The shelter must have a waterproof roof and good drainage to prevent mud. Position the opening away from prevailing winds.</li>
                            <li><strong>Good Ventilation:</strong> Ample airflow is crucial to prevent ammonia buildup and respiratory issues, but it must be draft-free at goat level. Vents near the roofline are ideal.</li>
                            <li><strong>Deep Bedding:</strong> In winter, use the "deep litter" method with straw or pine shavings. Add fresh bedding on top and clean out the whole shelter in the spring. This creates a natural heat-composting pack.</li>
                            <li><strong>Space:</strong> Plan for at least 15-20 square feet of indoor space per full-sized goat.</li>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4">Goat-Proof Fencing</h2>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">The saying is true: if it can't hold water, it can't hold a goat. Goats are intelligent and persistent escape artists.</p>

                        <ul class="space-y-2 mt-2 list-disc list-inside text-slate-700">
                            <li><strong>Height:</strong> 48 inches is the absolute minimum. 60 inches (5 feet) is better, especially for more athletic breeds like Nigerians.</li>
                            <li><strong>Material:</strong> 2"x4" or 4"x4" woven wire "no-climb" fencing is the gold standard. It prevents goats from getting their heads stuck and is strong enough to deter most predators.</li>
                            <li><strong>Posts:</strong> Use solid wood or T-posts spaced no more than 8-10 feet apart. Corner and gate posts must be securely braced.</li>
                        </ul>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4">Rotational Grazing & Temporary Fencing</h2>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">For small herds (4 goats or fewer), you don't need to fence your entire property. A movable pen made from livestock panels is an excellent, cost-effective solution.</p>
                <ul class="space-y-3 list-disc list-inside text-slate-700">
                    <li><strong>Livestock Panels:</strong> Use four 16-foot livestock or cattle panels to create a temporary, movable square pen. This allows you to practice rotational grazing, which is healthier for your pasture and drastically reduces internal parasite loads.</li>
                    <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> By constantly moving the goats to fresh ground, you leave their manure (and any parasite eggs) behind, breaking the parasite life cycle. It also makes better use of your available forage.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4">Securing Your Gates</h2>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Gates are the weakest point in your fencing. Goats will learn to operate simple latches.</p>
                <ul class="space-y-3 list-disc list-inside text-slate-600">
                    <li>Use latches that require lifting and sliding to open.</li>
                    <li>For extra security, add a carabiner clip or a chain with a snap hook to every gate latch.</li>
                    <li>Ensure gates swing freely and don't sag, which can create gaps for goats to squeeze through.</li>
                </ul>
