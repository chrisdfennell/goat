                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Goats hate being wet and need a place to escape wind, rain, snow, and summer sun. A simple three-sided structure is often sufficient.</p>

                        <ul class="space-y-3 list-disc list-inside text-slate-700">
                            <li><strong>Keep it Dry:</strong> The shelter must have a waterproof roof and good drainage to prevent mud. Position the opening away from prevailing winds.</li>
                            <li><strong>Good Ventilation:</strong> Ample airflow is crucial to prevent ammonia buildup and respiratory issues, but it must be draft-free at goat level. Vents near the roofline are ideal.</li>
                            <li><strong>Deep Bedding:</strong> In winter, use the "deep litter" method with straw or pine shavings. Add fresh bedding on top and clean out the whole shelter in the spring. This creates a natural heat-composting pack.</li>
                            <li><strong>Space:</strong> Plan for at least 15-20 square feet of indoor space per full-sized goat.</li>

                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">The saying is true: if it can't hold water, it can't hold a goat. Goats are intelligent and persistent escape artists.</p>

                        <ul class="space-y-2 mt-2 list-disc list-inside text-slate-700">
                            <li><strong>Height:</strong> 48 inches is the absolute minimum. 60 inches (5 feet) is better, especially for more athletic breeds like Nigerians.</li>
                            <li><strong>Material:</strong> 2"x4" or 4"x4" woven wire "no-climb" fencing is the gold standard. It prevents goats from getting their heads stuck and is strong enough to deter most predators.</li>
                            <li><strong>Posts:</strong> Use solid wood or T-posts spaced no more than 8-10 feet apart. Corner and gate posts must be securely braced.</li>
                        </ul>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4">Securing Your Gates</h2>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Gates are the weakest point in your fencing. Goats will learn to operate simple latches.</p>
                <ul class="space-y-3 list-disc list-inside text-slate-600">
                    <li>Use latches that require lifting and sliding to open.</li>
                    <li>For extra security, add a carabiner clip or a chain with a snap hook to every gate latch.</li>
                    <li>Ensure gates swing freely and don't sag, which can create gaps for goats to squeeze through.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4">Rotational Grazing & Temporary Fencing</h2>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">For those with a small herd (four or fewer goats), a permanent perimeter fence may be more than you need. A movable, temporary enclosure using livestock panels is a fantastic and flexible option.</p>
                <ul class="space-y-3 list-disc list-inside text-slate-700">
                    <li><strong>The Setup:</strong> Simply connect four 16-foot livestock panels to form a square pen. This gives your goats a generous area to browse while keeping them secure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Benefits of Rotation:</strong> Moving the panels every few days to a fresh patch of ground is a powerful strategy for parasite control. Goats are constantly moving away from their own manure, which dramatically reduces their exposure to worm larvae.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pasture Health:</strong> This method also improves pasture health by preventing overgrazing and allowing areas to recover and regrow.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="mt-4 bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 text-blue-900 p-4 rounded-r-lg text-sm">
                    <strong>Tip:</strong> Even with temporary fencing, goats must always have access to their main three-sided shelter for protection from the elements.
